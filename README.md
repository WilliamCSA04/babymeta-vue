# Babymetal Vue

More than a hello world less than a real project. The motivation behind this is study [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) to learn its dificulties and how this framework does work.
This project setup was made using _vue-cli_ with the following command `vue create babymetal-vue`.

## Commands

- Run `yarn dev` to run it locally
- Run `yarn lint` to run eslint.
